## Why these dotfiles?

**They are my ultimate configuration for all desktops**

  * They are awesome

## Installation

To awesomify your machine, run this:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darfink/dotfiles/master/install.sh | sh
```

The script will guide you through the entire installation process. It was crafted with the intention of being entirely automatic. That means no other configuration or installation is required after the script is finished.

### Upgrading

Upgrading is easy as a slice of pie.

```bash
dotfiles update
```
